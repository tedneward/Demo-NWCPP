# Mojo
This project was created via `magic init --format mojoproject`. That in turn created a hidden `.magic` directory that contains the "environment" for the project. This is updated/downloaded via `magic update`, which downloads and installs a LOT of stuff.

Run the sample code by *either*:

* Dropping into a "magic shell" by running:

    * `magic shell` (which will actually download some stuff on first run)
    * `mojo sample.mojo`
    * `exit` (to exit the shell)

* Or by running:

    * `magic run mojo sample.mojo`
